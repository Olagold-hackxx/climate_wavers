# Climate Wavers Backend

The Climate Wavers backend is the core of the Climate Wavers platform, an AI-driven social network focused on climate-based disaster responses. This backend is built with Django and incorporates various tools and technologies to provide robust and scalable services. It handles user authentication, data management, AI-driven content creation, notifications, and more.

## Introduction

Climate Wavers is an innovative platform that integrates social networking with climate action. The backend serves as the foundation, enabling features like disaster response reporting, community engagement, reforestation initiatives, AI-driven insights, and real-time notifications. This backend is designed to be highly modular, supporting various services and microservices that work together to provide a seamless experience.

## Architecture Overview

The Climate Wavers backend is built on a microservices architecture, with different components handling specific tasks:

- **Django Web Application:** The core application handles user management, content management, and integration with AI models.
- **Queue Consumer (Part of Django Backend):** This component is responsible for receiving content for AI-generated posts from the response system via RabbitMQ and creating posts on behalf of the AI. It ensures that AI-driven content is seamlessly integrated into the platform.
- **Response System (Node.js Microservice):** Handles all real-time operations of the application, including AI chatbot interactions, real-time disaster reports, and other real-time features. This microservice operates independently but communicates with the Django backend via RabbitMQ for task processing.
- **Notification Service (Node.js Microservice):** This service is responsible for sending notifications such as emails based on events triggered by the backend. It uses RabbitMQ to listen for events and dispatch notifications in real time.
- **RabbitMQ:** Acts as a message broker, enabling communication between the Django backend and the Node.js microservices for asynchronous task processing.
- **PostgreSQL Database:** Manages all persistent data, including user information, posts, comments, and more.
- **Redis:** Used for caching, session management, and as a broker for Celery (if needed).
- **AI Models Integration:** Climate Wavers integrates AI models for tasks like disaster recognition and magnitude analysis, using tools like Stability AI models and AWS Bedrock.

## Tools and Technologies

### Django
Django is the main framework used for building the backend. It provides a powerful ORM, admin interface, and a solid foundation for building web applications.

### Queue Consumer (Django Backend)
The queue consumer is an integral part of the Django backend, responsible for receiving content for AI-generated posts from the response system via RabbitMQ. It creates posts for AI within the platform, ensuring that AI-generated content is seamlessly published and visible to users.

### Response System (Node.js Microservice)
The response system, built with Node.js, handles all real-time aspects of the application. This includes AI chatbot interactions, real-time disaster reports, and other real-time features essential for the Climate Wavers platform. It operates independently but communicates with the Django backend via RabbitMQ for task processing.

### Notification Service (Node.js Microservice)
The notification service is responsible for sending out notifications, such as emails, based on events triggered by the backend. For example, when a new post is created or a disaster report is generated, the notification service sends appropriate notifications to users. It listens for events via RabbitMQ and ensures that users are informed in real-time.

### RabbitMQ
RabbitMQ is used as a message broker to manage communication between different services. It facilitates asynchronous processing of tasks like creating AI-generated posts, handling real-time interactions via the Node.js microservice, and sending notifications.

### PostgreSQL
PostgreSQL is the database of choice for Climate Wavers. It provides robust and reliable data storage, ensuring that all user data, posts, and other critical information are securely stored and efficiently retrieved.

### Redis
Redis serves as both a caching layer and a message broker for tasks that require fast, in-memory data storage. It's crucial for managing sessions, caching frequently accessed data, and ensuring quick responses.

### Docker
Docker is used to containerize the entire application, making it easy to manage, scale, and deploy across different environments. Docker Compose simplifies the orchestration of multiple services.

### AI Models
Climate Wavers integrates AI models for disaster recognition and magnitude analysis. These models are crucial for providing insights into climate-related events and helping communities respond effectively.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose
- Make (for using the Makefile commands)

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/climatewavers-backend.git
cd climatewavers-backend
```
